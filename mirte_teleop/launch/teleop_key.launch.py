# Due to the different implementation of launchfiles
# (https://github.com/ros2/teleop_twist_keyboard/issues/21)
# one is not able to run teleop_twist_keyboard from
# a launchfile. The xterm workaround is considered to be
# too much of a workaround on a headless machine.
# Solution: Start the node the hard way from a python
# subprocess.
# TODO: Get the lib location in a more generic way

# FIXME: This differs between the Pioneer and the Master...
# OPT-TODO: Set it to publish stamped directly
# Currently parameters (turn/speed) are not implemented in ROS2
